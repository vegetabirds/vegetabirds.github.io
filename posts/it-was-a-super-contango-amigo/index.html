<p>OMG! The Oil price went all negative!</p>
<p>Or did it? Was it a big deal?</p>
<p>To really understand what “negative oil price” implies, let’s start with some basics.</p>
<h1 id="crude-oil">Crude Oil</h1>

<p>Right, first question I guess, is “what is this ‘oil’ we are talking about?”. Is it the gas I put in my car? Does that mean I get to go to the gas station and get paid to fill up my car?</p>
<p>No, unfortunately you are like not going to get paid to fill up your car. You still have to pay some money for the gasoline, cheaper than normal though.</p>
<p>The oil we are talking about is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum">crude oil</a> or petroleum. Crude oil is a naturally occurring, yellowish-black liquid found in… No, no we are not reading the wikipedia here. Crude oil is the non-refined oil that is extracted from the ground or the bottom of the sea (which is also ground), formed from old old dinosaur bodies. Gasoline along with a few other types of fuels are the result of refining crude oil.</p>
<p>So, even if oil is free or negatively priced, you are very likely still have to pay for gas for all the refining processes, transportation and tax…</p>

<p>There are 2 important prices when we talk about a commodity like oil, spot price and future price.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot_contract">Spot price</a> is the price determined in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot_market">spot market</a>, where a physical exchange of oil happens, like a refinery buying barrels of oil from the producers. The cash/credit price the buyer pays for the oil is the spot price (why it’s spot market is also called cash market).</p>
<p>Where are the spot markets you ask. Well, as you can probably imagine, buying and selling huge quantities of oil is more of a one-to-one, point-to-point sale. So depending on who the buyers and sellers are, it can be between various parties, including producers, refineries, trading firms, distributors and so on.</p>
<p>The second price is the future price, that is determined by the exchange of oil futures in a futures market.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-futures">What is &ldquo;Futures&rdquo;</h1>

<p>Not that…</p>
<p>Futures is a financial contract where two parties agree on exchanging the underlying financial instrument (like a market index), or a commodity (like oil), at a set time (expiration) in the future (hence the name), at a set price (strike price), regardless of what the current price or the spot price of in the future for the underlying product.</p>
<p>If it reads a little confusing, consider this example: My neighbor Mike and I agree that in 2 weeks time, when I run out of toilet paper because of the quarantine, he will have to sell me a roll at $10 and I’ll have to buy it. What Mike and I just entered is a futures contract for one roll of toilet paper, expiring in 2 weeks, at the strike price of $10. Simple!</p>
<p>Now you would probably say why would people do this, instead of buying whatever they need now at the current price? Or buy it when you need it later?</p>
<p>There are potentially many reasons to enter into a future contract. But the main reasons I can summarize are: cost reduction, guarantee of supply/sales, hedging and trading/speculation. Let’s break them down, shall we?</p>
<h2 id="cost-reduction">Cost Reduction</h2>
<p>Imagine an refinery refining oil at a set pace at 1000 barrels of crude oil daily. For the whole month, it will go through 30,000 barrels and about 360,000 for the year. If the refinery buys all of these at once for the whole year, it will have to store them somewhere and sometimes huge storage isn’t part of a refinery so they will have to get extra room or pay for them. This is not necessarily something a refinery might want to handle. So instead, they enter a futures contract with a supplier, maybe monthly, so that each month they get oil delivered but only the amount they can go through in that month. No more worries on storage! And the crude oil intake cost is set.</p>
<h2 id="guarantee-of-supplysales">Guarantee of supply/sales</h2>
<p>Let’s go with beef for a toy example this time. A steak house needs 1000 steaks per month, but for the October beef fest, they are going to need 5000 instead. But what if when October comes, the supply is tight and 5000 is hard to come by? They can enter a futures contract with their beef supplier for 5000 steaks expiring in October for a set price. Since the contract is obligatory, if the supplier fails to supply it, there is potentially a lawsuit coming up and compensation. The same goes if the steak house failed to do the purchase.</p>
<p>Is there a steak futures? I don’t know, but the idea works and there are real life applications just like this, just probably for cows and corns instead of steaks.</p>
<h2 id="hedging">Hedging</h2>
<p>In the steak story, the goal of our steak house owner is of course to get enough steaks for the beef fest. If, let’s say, the steak house realizes it has enough for the beef fest and the supplier is coincidentally a little tight with inventory and is ok with not exchanging cash for steaks, so they settle the contract entirely in cash instead.</p>
<p>One can calculate the exact worth of a futures contract to a party and that’s where hedging comes from.</p>
<p>In real life, an airline, for example, whose cost varies heavily depending on the fuel price, would sometimes want to enter into a calculated crude oil futures position (a good proxy to fuel price), in case where fuel price rises raising the operational cost, but then they get compensated (hedged) by the difference in the futures contract.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with futures pricing. See an <a href="#futures-pricing">special section</a> in the appendix about this.</p>
<h2 id="speculation">Speculation</h2>
<p>We talked about how futures can be calculated into a cash value, and indeed most futures offer a cash settlement option (no delivery of underlying product). And in our modern highly regulated futures market, such as the <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/">CME</a> (Chicago Mercantile Exchange), futures are re-priced everyday and every second. And the contracts themselve can be sold to and bought from others (Only the party holding the contract at expiration faces settlement, cash or not).</p>
<p>The cash settlement, the tradability, the availability of repricing and the liquidity enable people to trade the futures contracts like products. And for trades that are purely trying to profit from the price change in contracts, without the aforementioned purposes are speculations.</p>

<p>After all these classroom materials, let’s get back to the <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-oils-june-contract-tumbles-25-to-around-21-year-low-as-expiring-may-contract-hangs-below-0-a-barrel-2020-04-21">headlines</a>. What actually went negative?</p>
<p>Simply, the (strike) price of May contract of <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/crude-oil/light-sweet-crude_contractSpecs_futures.html">NYMEX WTI Crude Oil futures (ticket: CL)</a> did on Apr.20.2020, Monday. But also, the “estimated spot price” of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Texas_Intermediate">WTI Crude Oil</a>.</p>
<p>The CL contract is simply a standardized contract for WTI crude oil (A type of crude oil). And the May contract expired on Apr.21. And since the last strike price will be the price that the settlement happens at, the futures prices close to expiration are expected to represent the spot price upon exercising the contracts (settlement).</p>
<p>However the real final price when settlement happened on Tuesday was $10.</p>
<h1 id="how-can-a-price-drop-to-negative">How can a price drop to negative?</h1>

</figure>

<p>Read most news, and it should give an explanation regarding how overproduction combined with underconsumption (almost no flights!) makes storage increasingly harder and more costly and it is better to sell at a negative price than keeping the oil on hand. This is true and in part it reflects how much the economy has come to a stop.</p>
<p>However, I would question is it the supply and demand of oil entirely, or also the supply and demand of the futures contract?</p>
<p>I would say both, and probably a non-trivial amount of the latter. We will come back to this in a later section. But first introduce Contango!</p>
<h2 id="contango">Contango</h2>


<figure class="article-figure">
    <img class="article-image" src="/posts/it-was-a-super-contango-amigo/contango.jpg" alt="Contango">
    
        <figcaption class="credit-text">Credit: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contango.asp]</figcaption>
    
    
</figure>


<p>Fancy word, it sounds like. What <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contango.asp">contango</a> really is, is a situation where the future (strike) price is higher than the spot price, or the further out future price is higher than one that expires nearer term.</p>
<p>In the case of oil, contango is almost always there, because the further out, the more cost in storage, hence higher the price.</p>
<p>Note however, at the point where the May contract drops to negative, the only one-month further out June contract was well at its $20s. And if you look at the price difference between any other months or historically, the difference shouldn’t be more than a few dollars at most. A more than $20 difference is rare to say the least. It was a “Super Contango”.</p>
<h1 id="real-world-vs-financial-world">Real World vs Financial World</h1>
<p>So what does this super contango tell us?
As mentioned briefly before, read most financial news like <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahhansen/2020/04/21/heres-what-negative-oil-prices-really-mean/#458f33405a85">Forbes</a>, it will tell you it is due to “as demand hits rock-bottom and storage tanks fill up, companies are now paying traders to take oil off their hands.”</p>
<p>However, I would take a few grains of salt with this kind of explanations:
<figure>
    <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l2Je3XfUgbYn8GCn6/giphy.gif" width="360" height="300"/> 
</figure>
</p>
<h2 id="first-grain-of-salt-the-people-in-oil-industry-knew-way-beforehand">First grain of salt: The people in oil industry knew way beforehand</h2>
<p>The one big reason being argued for creating the super contango is the over-supply, under-demand situation we are in. Of course we are in one. And yes, with the fear of running out of place to store oil right now, people have reasons to sell oil at lower and lower price.</p>
<p>However, did the people who work in the oil industry, buying and selling directly not know about the situation before April the 20th? Of course they did, and they should have known for over a month! When fewer people bought oil, when inventory piled up, they knew.</p>
<p>If anything, it was the financial world catching up with the reality of the demand and supply of the physical world.</p>
<h2 id="second-grain-of-salt-what-about-the-speculation">Second grain of salt: What about the speculation?</h2>
<p>By attributing the price drop only to the demand and supply of oil leaves out a huge part of the price action: hedgers and speculators. And that liquidity added the “oil” on the fire.</p>
<p>A few things really good to know here:</p>
<ol>
<li>A CL futures contract is a physical delivery settlement only contract, meaning if you hold the contract at the end, you are obligated to buy the oil.</li>
<li>When futures contracts are towards the expiration, trading starts shifting to future months contracts, leaving lower and lower liquidity for the current month contract.</li>
<li>It is estimated by CME that less than 2% of the commodity futures contracts traded on the exchange result in physical settlement.</li>
</ol>
<p>What these mean is that most people who buy the crude contracts never wanted any oil in the first place. Then, what do you do when something you don’t really want is going down in price and not many people want it? You lower the price, more and more aggressively to get rid of it, even into negative prices.</p>
<p>In addition, when the price of futures goes down like it did for oil on the 20th, sellers are the main action force. What I mean by this is that there weren’t really a lot of real oil sellers entering futures positions willingly to sell oil at a low price, but mainly the people who didn&rsquo;t want to buy oil selling contracts in a final hurry to real buyers of oil at a discount.</p>
<p>From news and statistics, we can actually see most of the holders of the contracts before the settlement likely had nothing to do with oil. And considering the physical settlement of the CL contract, if I were to speculate, the way down of oil price from 20ish to negative 30 something should smell like burning butts of a healthy mix of hedge funds, oil ETFs and retail speculators, who didn’t have space in living room or office to store thousands of barrels of oil.</p>
<p>One example of the contract holders trying to get out was, all over the news, the <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bank-of-china-sold-oils-may-contract-into-a-historic-implosion-in-crude-and-retail-investors-may-haven-gotten-crushed-2020-04-22">oil ETF by Bank of China</a>, which eventually translates to just normal people buying a product many of whom don’t even understand.</p>
<h2 id="third-grain-of-salt-selling-oil-for-negative-prices-didnt-happen">Third grain of salt: Selling oil for negative prices didn’t happen</h2>
<p>I have read in some news sentences like this: “Those prices—at negative $4.47 per barrel—mean that companies must now pay a buyer to take oil off their hands and store it if they want to exit the market. ”</p>
<p>But here is the thing, paying buyers to take oil didn’t really happen. The final settlement price on the following Tuesday was about $10, which was the price settlement really happened at, which was a very reasonable price that had been reported to be the exact spot price in some other exchange location around the world before this. Again, the financial world is catching up with the physical world.</p>
<p>I get how news has the need to project an image of “The Great Depression” when “farmers burning crops, milk workers dumping milk in the river…”, and now oil producers pay people to take oil. But hey, it just didn’t really happen. It was just the futures price that did, for a bit.</p>
<h2 id="to-summarize">To Summarize</h2>
<p>What I make out of the negative oil price are essentially two points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The $20 to $10 final price drop reflected the supply and demand situation that is in the physical world and was a catch-up the financial world did with the real world.</li>
<li>The negative prices, rather than saying it reflected the supply demand of oil, I would say it reflected the supply demand of oil futures instead.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="was-it-a-big-deal">Was it a big deal?</h1>
<p>So was the negative oil price a big deal? Yes and no.</p>
<p>For some of the real buyers and sellers of oil, sure, but as mentioned before, I imagine it is more of a partial manifestation of the issues already there in the energy market during this trying time, rather than a root cause of issues.</p>
<p>For hedgers and speculators with big money in it. Of course.</p>
<p>For normal folks investing in oil. Maybe, depending on what they bought. Coming back to this soon.</p>
<p>For people who are just putting gasoline in their cars? Maybe not so much.</p>
<p>And certainly, a negative oil price is sort of a rare sight in the financial world and it does reflect the financial weakness to a point. But in addition, oil driven production and transportation is and should be taking its downturn now, so an oversupply problem has been there before this pandemic. And just a side note, if you look at electricity prices (especially wind power),  it goes to negative territory all the time. It’s all supply and demand, sometimes of the product itself, sometimes of the derivatives of the product.</p>
<h1 id="final-notes">Final Notes</h1>
<p>I do hope this article gives some facts and perspectives about the oil crash, separating the memes and headlines from some insights. I certainly made more discoveries and ended with a clearer thought writing this article.</p>
<p>I intend to discuss two more topics on oil in separate articles. One is how low oil prices affect our path to alternative energies. I have read that many people think with lower oil prices the EVs of the world will become less attractive thus delaying our transition into the cleaner world. I however came to the opposite conclusion and will explain more fully next time. The other is to throw out some investment ideas around oil. I am invested in oil in a few ways and am hoping to develop a more complete view on that as well.</p>
<h1 id="appendix">Appendix</h1>
<h2 id="futures-pricing">Futures Pricing</h2>
<p>A futures contract has a value or price, to both the buyer and the seller.</p>
<p>In the steak house story, at expiration, for the buyer (owner), the contract is worth the value of 5000 steaks minus the cash paid out, and for the seller (supplier), the contract is worth 5000 times the strike price per steak minus the value of steaks given out.</p>
<p>Now since they agreed on cash settlement, steaks are out of the picture. They should pay each other what the contract is worth to the other party, but in cash. How much cash is a steak worth today? Well, it’s simply how much it’s sold on the market today, hence the current spot price of a steak.</p>
<p>For the buyer
Contract Worth = 5000 steaks - 5000 * strike price
= 5000 * spot price - 5000 * strike price
= 5000 * (spot price - strike price)</p>
<p>And for the seller
Contract Worth = 5000 * strike price - 5000 steaks
= 5000 * strike price - 5000 * spot price
= 5000 * (strike price - spot price)</p>
<p>As you can see, the value of the contract now entirely depends on how the strike price is relative to the spot price. If the strike price is higher, the buyer pays the seller the difference and vice versa.</p>
